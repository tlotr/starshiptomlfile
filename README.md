My .toml file for Starship

Official website: https://starship.rs/

Github: https://github.com/starship/starship

Place the **starship.toml** file in ~/.config/

If you are using a desktop then remove everything under battery and only add **disabled: true**

This is remove the annoying message from the terminal of not finding the battery.
